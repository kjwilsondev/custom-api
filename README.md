# Spotify Data Project

This is project inspired by https://musicaldata.com
I will be creating an API that recieves data from the Spotify API and displays data in charts using Chart.js

These graphs will demonstrate correlation between information gathered from the final project I did for DS 1.1 course at Make School.
